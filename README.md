# My FAC19 journey

[Founders and Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/)¬†is a highly selective 18-week full-stack Javascript development bootcamp in London. It is peer-led and project-based, entirely done pair-programming. 

To apply I needed to complete a list of¬†[prerequisites](https://github.com/glrta/glrta-portfolio-fac#application-prerequisites). After submission, I was invited for an interview and then finally offered a place at the 2020 spring cohort üéâ, that ran from March to June 2020.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†My [application](http://glrta.github.io/fac19-application) website built as part of the prerequisites. 

‚ûó¬†[Calculator](https://github.com/glrta/calc) built as a pre-course project for FAC19.

## First half

During the first 9 weeks of the programme is focused on JavaScript stack fundamentals. Each week we are introduced to a new topic and tasked with a project, user stories and accentance criteria focused on the week's topic.  An MVP is built in 1.5 days by 4 developers that follow the Agile methodology. The course material is all open source and available [here](https://founders-and-coders.gitbook.io/coursebook/).

## Second half

The second half of the course is focused on two projects addressing a specific real-world problem: one student project and one client project as part of the [Tech for Better](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/tech-for-better/) programme. Both are build from concept to deliver over one design week and two one-week build sprints.

**1. Student project: :clapper: Bechdel and Beyond**

- Created a community-driven app that allows users to rate and find films based on gender representation on screens and behind the scenes.
- My role: as QA lead I ensured the API and the client side had over 90% test coverage and that user journeys were tested end-to-end with Cypress.
- Tech used : Node.js | Express | PostgreSQL | React | Material UI | Jest | Tape | Cypress | Travis | Codecov

**2. Client project: :rocket: Enterprise Adventure**

- Developed a React + Netlify + Airtable concept app for the non-profit Teach a Man to Fish, whose mission is to empower young people in Asia, Africa and Latin America with skills to succeed in school, work and life.
- My role: as UX\UI lead I coordinated user testing, revised product design and ensured accessibility.
- Tech used : React | Style Components | Material UI | Jest | Codecov |  Netlify dev | Airtable
